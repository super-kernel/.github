This project is developed based on PHP 8.4 and is backward compatible.
Prior to this, we have been dealing with and have solved the following original intentions for the establishment of the project:

1. Environment-free self-executable files
2. `AOP` aspect-oriented development.
3. Independent phar dependency library, not composer installation tool.
4. Development concept based on swoole (we encourage and advocate developers to use cli mode).
5. Smaller and more complete dependency management tool.
6. Minimum OOP-based development.

Therefore, we will end the research and development work from January 17, 2025, and it is expected that this set of development concepts will be perfected in the middle of the year and can be used for development.

Notice: This project has been launched, but no developers have joined yet. There may be time factors in promoting the project.
