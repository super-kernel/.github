> SuperKernel is a modern PHP framework powered by the Swoole extension.
>
> It is clarified that PHP is being constrained from a **dynamic scripting language** to a **controlled runtime language
**, and developers should not focus on the **pre-bootstrapping phase**.  
> It provides components implemented according to **PSR standards**, and offers flexible component replacement and
> extension capabilities through a **DI container**.  
> We are committed to exploring the future possibilities of PHP in high performance and system programming.

## 🚀 Design Philosophy

1. **Zero Environment Setup** – When generating source code and running it with PHP, there is no need to install a PHP
   environment.
2. **Auto Boot Lifecycle** – Framework-managed startup and shutdown.
3. **Native AOP Support** – Elegant aspect-oriented design.
4. **Swoole-Centric** – Embrace async, coroutine, and concurrency.
5. **Multi-Protocol Support** – Unified abstraction for HTTP, WebSocket, TCP, and UDP, and MQTT.
6. **PSR-Based Components** – Replaceable, extensible, and standalone.
7. **Strongly Typed Configurations** – Clarity and strict validation.

## ⚙️ Installation

### Composer

If your system does not yet have PHP installed, you can go to
👉 [wheakerd/skernel - Releases](https://github.com/wheakerd/skernel/releases) to download the executable Composer
binary (no PHP environment required).

### Skernel

Visit the [Skernel](https://github.com/wheakerd/skernel) repository to learn how to download, install, and use this
build tool.

### Installing SuperKernel

Create a brand new SuperKernel project using Composer:

```bash
composer create-project super-kernel/super-kernel-skeleton
```

## 🧩 Quick Start

### Configuring the skernel tool

```json
{
  "description": "Project template for the SuperKernel framework.",
  "type": "project",
  "license": "MIT",
  "extra": {
    "skernel": {
      "name": "skernel"
      // The name selected during the build, `bin` is used by default.
    }
  }
}
```

```bash
skernel build \
&& chmod +x target/release/bin \
&& target/release/bin start
```

- If a build artifact name was defined, run it with the actual artifact.

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

```text
SuperKernel
 ├── Skernel Tools      # Tool and runtime support, aspect programming and class scanning mechanism
 ├── DI Container       # Definers, Resolvers, Lazy Instance Storage
 ├── Server Components  # HTTP/WebSocket/TCP and other service modules
 ├── Event Dispatcher   # Lifecycle and event system
 ├── PSR-Compatible     # PSR-3, PSR-7, PSR-11, PSR-15, PSR-17
```

## 📦 Current Progress

SuperKernel has implemented core operational mechanisms, including:

- Container definition source and resolver factory system
- Lifecycle scheduler and custom process mechanism
- Automatic component registration and service manager
- Class map generation

⚠️ Note:
This project is still under development. If using this for production, please ensure you have advanced PHP and Swoole
development experience.

## 🧭 Roadmap

- [ ] Improved testing system
- [ ] Plug-in extension system
- [x] Multi-service coordinated scheduling
- [ ] AOP scanner optimization
- [ ] Improved official documentation and examples

## 💬 To Developers

> SuperKernel is not just a framework, but a philosophy:
> "Return PHP to systems programming and explore the limits of the language."
